# Lana Backend Challenge

For this backend challenge you have to create a simple API in Go. This API will store a complete transaction history for transactions between users. For example:

User 1 | User 2 | Amount | When
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
1 | 2 | 10.00 | 2019-01-01
2 | 1 | 5.00 | 2019-01-01
1 | 3 | 6.49 | 2019-01-01

Remember that this is only an example. You don't need to do exactly this way, in fact, this is not even a good way to solve this challenge.

What do we expect from you in this test:

1. Your project should be tested;
2. Your project should compile and run;
3. Your project should be ready for production;
4. Your project should be documented;
5. Your project should be well organized;
6. Your project should be readable;
7. Your project should be maintainable;
8. Your project should scale;
9. Your project should be written in Go;

Aside from the programming language, we're not defining anything else as mandatory. The decisions on archtecture, structure, external services and dependencies are all up to you. We just need two things:

* Everything should work out of the box with some kind of documentation on the README;
* You *must* explain every decision so we can easaly follow your thought process. Use the README for that too;

### Bonus points

This is *your* project! Everyhing you want to show us just put in here and we'll definitely appreciate it. If you really want to make a good impression, here's some tips:

* tests are great tools and we love them
* docker and kubernetes all the way from development to production
* great developers make great documentations
* why you would do something manually when it can be automated?
* we are developers but we also own the project and our ideas matter
* commit messages can be an awesome time machine

Don't forget: this is *your* project. Do anything you want with it. You don't agree with the basic structure? Change it! Don't agree with the programming language? Use another one! You can do anything here, we just ask for you to explain why on the README.
